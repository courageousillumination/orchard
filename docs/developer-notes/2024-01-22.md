Well we all have start somewhere. I'm a bit nervous about committing this documentation to git, but yolo. The goal of the orchard project is primairly personal to give me a personal project to expand upon. However, I have a vision, that is more expansive. I've been doing software development professionally for almost 10 years, and it's absurd how slow things still are. Large tests that don't catch issues, spaghetti code, fighting linters, types that people don't understand. My real vision here is to create some of the next generation of tools, languages, and developer experience. I like the name Orchard because specific things from this could be transplanted elsewhere. Oooo Greenhouse is also a good name, but oh well too late.

Now, those are high aspirations. As I said, the main goal is personal. So where do we start? I think with the programming language. Code name: Orange. I will have a lot of missteps, but I think maybe we start by defining the outputs I would like? Part of the problem is that I'm not as up on the programming language literature as I would like.

Also, until we can self host, we'll need to figure out my base language. And am I using a toolchain like LLVM? Would be nice to just kind of write the frontend and let LLVM pick up the slack.

Man, I think we have some big questions too about paradigms. Functional? Object oriented (kind of meh). Concurrency and how should we handle that? There are a lot of unknowns here.
